I'm currently a junior at UH majoring in CS, with interests in Machine Learning and Cybersecurity. 
When I'm not studying, I am at the gym hitting PR's. I also enjoy reading on my off time (particularly HackerNews forums) :) 
What I hope to get from this course is: An appreciation for VR/AR technology, and a more in-depth understanding of Unity.
